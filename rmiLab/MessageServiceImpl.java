/* MessageServiceImpl is an example of a Remote Object. As this class implements the remote
 * interface MessageService, it must also implement the remote method:
 *			public Message getMessage() throws RemoteException
 * MessageServiceImpl also is a subclass of UnicastRemoteObject. This superclass provides the remote
 * object with all the functionality it needs to communicate with the server-side skeleton - the
 * object that is responsible for unmarshalling client requests on the server and marshalling
 * responses. Note that the stub used by the client to communicate with the server is generated
 * from this class with the following command from a console:
 *				rmic gmit.MessageServiceImpl
 * This will generate a stub called MessageServiceImpl_Stub.class. Client invocations are routed
 * through the stub, over the network to the skeleton and on to the remote object.
 * 
 * The remote object is the ultimate for a remote method invocation. Before any remote client can
 * invoke any of its methods, the remote object must first be instantiated and bound to a naming
 * registry with a human-readable name. This binding is done in the class MessageServer.
